## My process

- Thought about the elements used in the design
- Entered every element in HTML
- Used `border` on every element to better see how they are positioned
- Adjusted the positioning first
- Adjusted the styling next
- At the end, took up a challenge to not use `@media`

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML

### What I learned

I better learned how to position the elements, but I think there are better ways.

Instead of using `@media`, I used `clamp` and viewport width to scale the elements down for smaller screens, as is designated in the design files.

### Continued development

The positioning of elements is mostly "hard-coded." I should have used `flex` to position overall elements instead of putting margin and padding to every little thing.

I am not satisfied with the usage of `clamp` and viewport width. It does the job, but I wanted that every element scales uniformly at the same time. I had to mostly guess the values. I would like know in the future what are other possibilites or if there is another way to use the two.
